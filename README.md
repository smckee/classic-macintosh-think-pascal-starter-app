# classic-macintosh-think-pascal-starter-app
Source code for creating an old-school, classic Macintosh application in THINK Pascal 4.0.

To view the Pascal source code, and to compile and run the classic Macintosh starter application, you will need to run a 680x0 Macintosh emulator such as [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/).

Once you have your emulator up and running, open the disk image (`Disk1.dsk`) provided in this repo and you'll find the THINK Pascal project file with all the source code, along with a pre-compiled version of the starter app.

If you are using Mini vMac, you can simply put the `Disk1.dsk` image in the same folder that your Mini vMac emulator is located, and it should boot from that disk when you start Mini vMac. Mini vMac will automatically mount any disk images it finds, named `Disk1.dsk`, `Disk2.dsk`, `Disk2.dsk`, etc, in the order they are numbered. The disk image in this repo includes System 7.1 on it.

Double-click the `App.Ï€` project file on the disk image to open THINK Pascal and to view the source code.

Double-click the `App` appliction to see the starter app running.
