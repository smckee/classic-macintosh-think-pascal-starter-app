# classic-macintosh-think-pascal-starter-app
The starter source code for an old-school, classic Macintosh application, provided as a THINK Pascal 4.0 project.

To view the Pascal source code, and to compile and run the classic Macintosh starter application, you will need to run a 680x0 Macintosh emulator such as [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/).

Once you have the emulator up and running, open the disk image (`Disk1.dsk`) provided in this repo and you'll find the THINK Pascal project file with all the source code, along with a pre-compiled version of the starter app.

If you are using Mini vMac, you can simply put the `Disk1.dsk` image in the same folder that your Mini vMac emulator is located, and it should boot from that disk you start Mini vMac. It includes System 7.1. Mini vMac will automatically mount any disk images named `Disk1.dsk`, `Disk2.dsk`, `Disk2.dsk`, etc, in the order they are numbered.

Double-click the `App.Ï€` project file on the disk image to open THINK Pascal and to view the source code.

Double-click the `App` appliction to see the starter up running.
